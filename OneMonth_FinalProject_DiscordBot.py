## Final Project. Use an API to access data. 

## Chosen API is Discord. https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
## Using discord.py library https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py 

## Plan to make a bot, which recognises new users, and assigns roles based on responses. # enable logging, to surface errors in console
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# import discord, and set intents (permissions for the bot)
import discord
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.members = True
intents.messages = True
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

# set variable for bot user id, bot token, and guild id
bot_id = YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE
bot_token = YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
guild_id = YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE

# set emoji variables
yn_emote = ['‚úîÔ∏è', '‚ùå']
c_emote = ['üü¶', 'üü©', 'üü®', 'üü•']

# set role variables
member_role = YOUR_ROLE_ID
team_blue = YOUR_ROLE_ID_BLUE
team_green = YOUR_ROLE_ID_GREEN
team_yellow = YOUR_ROLE_ID_YELLOW
team_red = YOUR_ROLE_ID_RED

# confirm client is running
@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('We have logged in as {0.user}'.format(client))

# recognise user joining, and send welcome direct message
@client.event

    # print name in console
    print (member.name, 'joined')
    # member = member
    # return member



# ensure emotes are only added to the apropriate message, and only when the message is created by the bot
@client.event

# recognise when user reacts to yn_emote, but ignore when bot adds reaction
# assign inital role if check is selected, or kick if cross is selected
# it is nessecary to target the correct guild, as the interaction is occuring in Direct Message. 
# As such trying to apply roles within DM fails, as guild is not present
# passing the guild ID alone, seems to be insufficiant, instead the full object must be loaded through get_guild()
# The same must be applied to member, as the user in the DM is a separate object from guild member
# role also requires a full object to be loaded, the ID as well is not sufficiant while within a DM.
